**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

BEM blocks are used.

Validation, popups, buttons, card rendering,smooth transtitions, cursors, mouse clicks, and various event listeners are implemented in this project

This project was refactored using OOP to update to a more comprehensible file structure.

Destructuring was used and classes were created in order to conform to the principles of OOP.
  
**Tech**  

 This project was started using a design from Figma.

Media Quaries were used to create a more responsive design.

Webpack was used for project building.  I set up bundling, transpiled JS, and minified the code.
